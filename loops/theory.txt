In Python, loops are control structures that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.  Python provides two main types of loops: for loops and while loops.

For Loops:
A for loop iterates over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

for item in sequence:
    # Code block to be executed for each item

While Loops:
A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.

while condition:
    # Code block to be executed as long as condition is True
