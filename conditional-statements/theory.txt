Conditional statements in Python are used to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition evaluates to true or false. The most common conditional statements in Python are:


if statement: The if statement allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. 

syntax : 

if condition:
    # block of code

else Statement: The else statement is used in conjunction with if. It provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition specified in the if statement evaluates to false.

if condition:
    # block of code 
else:
    # block of code
