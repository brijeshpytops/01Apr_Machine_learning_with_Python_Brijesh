"""
Tuple -  ordered, immutable, duplicate values are allowed, indexing, slicing

A tuple is another built-in data structure similar to a list, but with some key differences. Like lists, tuples are used to store collections of items. However, tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

syntax : 

tuple_name = ()
tuple_name = tuple()
comma_tuple = 1,
