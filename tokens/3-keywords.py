"""
In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes within the language. These keywords are predefined and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names or function names). Keywords are used to define the syntax and structure of Python code.

Welcome to Python 3.12's help utility! If this is your first time using
Python, you should definitely check out the tutorial at
https://docs.python.org/3.12/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To get a list of available
modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, enter "modules", "keywords",
"symbols", or "topics".

Each module also comes with a one-line summary of what it does; to list
the modules whose name or summary contain a given string such as "spam",
enter "modules spam".

To quit this help utility and return to the interpreter,
enter "q" or "quit".

False: Boolean value representing false.
None: Represents the absence of a value or null.
True: Boolean value representing true.
and: Logical operator performing logical AND operation.
as: Used for aliasing during imports or in context managers.
assert: Used for debugging to ensure a condition is true.
async: Declares an asynchronous function or context manager.
await: Used to suspend execution in asynchronous functions until awaited coroutine completes.
break: Exits the innermost loop or switch statement.
class: Declares a class.
continue: Skips the rest of the loop's code and continues to the next iteration.
def: Declares a function or method.
del: Deletes a variable or an element in a list or dictionary.
elif: Stands for "else if", used in conditional statements.
else: Executes if the condition of an if statement is false.
except: Catches exceptions in try blocks.
finally: Always executed block of code, whether exception is raised or not.
for: Iterates over items of a sequence or any iterable.
from: Used in import statements to import specific attributes or submodules.
global: Declares a variable as global inside a function.
if: Conditional statement.
import: Imports modules or objects into a namespace.
in: Tests if a sequence contains a certain value.
is: Tests object identity.
lambda: Creates an anonymous function.
nonlocal: Declares a variable as non-local in a nested function.
not: Logical operator performing logical NOT operation.
or: Logical operator performing logical OR operation.
pass: Placeholder indicating no operation to be performed.
raise: Raises an exception.
return: Exits a function and optionally returns a value.
try: Used for exception handling.
while: Looping construct, executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.
with: Context manager to simplify resource management.
yield: Pauses execution of a generator function and yields a value to its caller.
