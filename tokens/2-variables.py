"""
In Python, a variable is a named location in memory used to store data. Variables are used to hold values such as numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, or any other data type. Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require explicit declaration of variables or their data types. When you assign a value to a variable, Python automatically determines the data type based on the assigned value.

syntax:

var_name = value
